# Example of a full species distribution modelling workflow
This example fits and projects species distribution models for the tree species _Eucaplytus regnans_ from scratch.

## Environmental data
We start by downloading environmental data. We use the [Rasters](www.github.com/rafaqz/Rasters.jl) package to handle raster data, and RasterDataSources.jl to automatically download Worldclim data.

In this example, we just download bioclimatic variables 1 and 12 (annual mean temperature and annual mean precipitation). We then mask to the country borders of Australia.

```@example test
using Rasters, RasterDataSources, ArchGDAL, NaturalEarth, DataFrames
bio = RasterStack(WorldClim{BioClim}, (1,12))
countries = naturalearth("ne_10m_admin_0_countries") |> DataFrame
australia = subset(countries, :NAME => ByRow(==("Australia"))).geometry
bio_aus = Rasters.trim(mask(bio; with = australia)[X = 110 .. 156, Y = -45 .. -10])
```

Let's plot this data to see what it looks like.

```@example test
using CairoMakie
Rasters.rplot(bio_aus)
```

## Occurrence data
Next, we use [GBIF2.jl](www.github.com/rafaqz/GBIF2.jl) to download occurrence records for this species. We use the [thin](@ref) function in this package to weed out occurrences that are very close to each other, using a cut-off of 5km.

```@example test
using GBIF2, SpeciesDistributionModels
sp = species_match("Eucalyptus regnans")
occurrences_raw = occurrence_search(sp; year = (1970,2000), country = "AU", hasCoordinate = true, limit = 2000)
occurrences = thin(occurrences_raw.geometry, 5000)
```

## Background points
Next, we sample random points to use as background points.

Let's plot both the occurrence and background points to see where _Eucalyptus regnans_ is found.

```@example test
using StatsBase # to active Rasters.sample
bg_data = Rasters.sample(bio_aus, 500; skipmissing = true, geometry = (X,Y))
bg_points = getproperty.(bg_data, :geometry)
fig, ax, pl = plot(bio_aus.bio1)
scatter!(ax, occurrences; color = :red)
scatter!(ax, bg_points; color = :grey)
fig
```

## Handling data
SpeciesDistributionModels.jl has a [sdmdata](@ref) function to handle input data. It takes tabular presence and background data as inputs, such as what is returned by `Rasters.extract` and `Rasters.sample`.

```@example test
using SpeciesDistributionModels
p_data = extract(bio_aus, occurrences; skipmissing = true)
data = sdmdata(p_data, bg_data; resampler = CV(nfolds = 3))
```

## Fitting an ensemble
Now that we have our `data` object with presence and background data, we can fit our ensemble. The `sdm` function fits a whole ensemble, taking two arguments: a data object and a `NamedTuple` with models the ensemble should have. This can be any MLJ-compatible model. In this case, we use Maxnet, boosted regression trees (from the EvoTrees.jl package), and a GLM.

```@example test
using Maxnet: MaxnetBinaryClassifier
using EvoTrees: EvoTreeClassifier
using MLJGLMInterface: LinearBinaryClassifier
models = (
  maxnet = MaxnetBinaryClassifier(),
  brt = EvoTreeClassifier(),
  glm = LinearBinaryClassifier()
)

ensemble = sdm(data, models)
```

## Evaluating an ensemble
We can evaluate the entire ensemble using any metric from [StatisticalMeasures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/StatisticalMeasures.jl).

```@example test
import SpeciesDistributionModels as SDM
ev = SDM.evaluate(ensemble; measures = (; auc, accuracy))
```

## Predicting
Next, we the climatic suitability of the species throughout Australia using `SpeciesDistributionModels.predict`. We can specify a `reducer` argument to get a single value, instead of a prediction for each member in the ensemble.

```@example test
pred = SDM.predict(ensemble, bio_aus; reducer = mean)
plot(pred; colorrange = (0,1))
```

## Understanding the model
[SDM.explain](@ref) offers tools to estimate the contribution and response curves for each variable. Currently, the only implemented method is Shapley values from the [Shapley.jl](www.gitlab.com/ExpandingMan/Shapley.jl) package.

```@example test
expl = SDM.explain(ensemble; method = ShapleyValues(8))
variable_importance(expl)
```

We can also interactively plot the model explanation to get response curves.
```@example test
interactive_response_curves(expl)
```
