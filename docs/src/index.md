# SpeciesDistributionModels

Documentation for [SpeciesDistributionModels](https://github.com/tiemvanderdeure/SpeciesDistributionModels.jl).

This package is under active development. Be advised that it may change at any time.

## Installation
This package is not registered yet, but can easily be installed directly from GitHub.
```julia
] add github.com/tiemvanderdeure/SpeciesDistributionModels.jl
```

## About this package
The goal of `SpeciesDistributionModels.jl` is to combine the convenience of species distribution modelling packages in R with the speed and intuitive syntax of Julia.

This package allows you to fit, evaluate, and project ensemble SDMs with just a few commands. It relies on [Rasters.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/Rasters.jl/) and the [MLJ](https://github.com/juliaai/mlj.jl) ecosystem, bringing together Julia's geospatial and machine learning ecosystems.
