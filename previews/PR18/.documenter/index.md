## About this package {#About-this-package}

The goal of `SpeciesDistributionModels.jl` is to combine the convenience of species distribution modelling packages in R with the speed and intuitive syntax of Julia.

This package allows you to fit, evaluate, and project ensemble SDMs with just a few commands. It relies on [Rasters.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/Rasters.jl/) and the [MLJ](https://github.com/juliaai/mlj.jl) ecosystem, bringing together Julia&#39;s geospatial and machine learning ecosystems.
